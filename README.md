<h1 align="center"> The Miserable Manual of OddLexity</h1>
<h3>This is a list of information on creating a Github website which I have gathered during plenty of researching.</h3> 
<h5>Unrelated: Our brains are literally becoming smaller when we become adults. As a kid, our teachers fed us. . .little bits of information when our brains were bigger and are capable of memorizing more.</h5>

[My site](https://oddlexity.github.io/CHESTERTALE/) <<<Example of a link.

To do this: Add [        ] for the visible text, and ( ) for the link.

<p><b>Creating links to interconnect the pages of your site</b> (hope this is not confusing):
  <br>
 Note: Everything will be done here in <b>github.com</b>
  <br>
<ol>1. ***If you have this, go to the next*** Create a file named <b>index.html</b>. Click commit changes. This is mainly the homepage of your site.
  <br>
2. Once done, make another file formatted like this: yourinput.html. Ex. "home.html". 
 <br>
3. Go back to the index.html which is most likely blank or you have already inserted a code in it. 
<br>
4. Insert <b>a href="yourinput.html"</b> Make sure you put the enclosing tags.
</ol>

<p>I'm sorry if this is messy. </p>
