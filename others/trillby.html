<p class="blocktext"><b>Hello</b>
<br><br>

The strong breeze and storm served the dusk. It was a morose weather for a decent country, and an unideal time to commit mischief. But, an outstanding murderer differs to defy: he favors the rain to kill his victims, as their teardrops get carried away along their sorrows. They’ll mourn the death of beloved ones, accusing the cause of their demise was because of them, knowing they have met an end at his hands—
<br><br>

“I’ve done it!”
<br><br>

His henchman eyed him. “You didn't go on a spree, did you?”
<br><br>

The stooge is slier and worked based on plans than reckless brawn. His black umbrella covered him. And the alley’s darkness masked his clothes.
<br><br>

“Didn't do, Frisk.”
<br><br>

“I don't believe you.” 
<br><br>

He laughed, spinning his dagger. “I target you-know-who.”
<br><br>

“Yeah, yeah.”
<br><br>

The siren’s arrival alerted them. The government attempted to pursue them aplenty, but they always escaped in the blink of an eye. And so they earned the title of top pursued evils.
<br><br>

“They’re here.” —Frisk aligned the umbrella to the center, and raindrops hit his trilby.— “Let’s go.”
<br><br>

He went to his back. “Aye-aye.”
<br><br>

Frisk made a turning motion to the umbrella’s canopies, and they vanished.
<br><br>

A crawling person on the roof saw them fade. They follow them but doesn't come near them. 
<br><br>

The Chief came to the alley and caught no one. She gave orders to find their whereabouts. Her instinct is remarkable. Her bullet-sharp eyes catch bitty trails of blood which commoners miss. Even in the rain where liquid proofs are erased. She glanced at the roof in a hunch, looking at nothing. Her subordinate notified the preceptors were nowhere to be seen. She left in irritation. “Tssk, that umbrella punk.”
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<b>Somewhere</b>
“Neat, the Chief’s speed improved!”
<br><br>

Frisk whacked the umbrella on him. “You kept stirring her senses with hints!”
<br><br>

“Don't worry. It's not like they’ll get to our lair because of it.” 
<br><br>

“It’s rash.”
<br><br>

He sat on a nearby chair and read a comic. “You got to relax sometimes.”
<br><br>

“Relax? Relax!? How can I take a break if you keep being immature!? And why of all mediums, you chose comics?”
<br><br>

“Because, for me, it's the only arteries. Maybe, I should be a cartoonist, but I’m not skilled enough. You could be a dramatist.”
<br><br>

Frisk protested his opinion, pointing out they don't have dreams to go after. 
<br><br>

“You need to be more hopeful, or you’ll die like the hopeless hero from this comic.”
<br><br>

“Don't compare that to reality!”
<br><br>

“Reality, reality. I wonder what really is real.”
<br><br>

“This is.”
<br><br>

“Is it?”
<br><br>

He readied a map of ——r victims, exing those he had slain. “Yes, it is!”
<br><br>

Their lair is large, but the light is limited for secrecy. “Look here.” 
<br><br>

He quieted, to Frisk’s distress. The leader he selected was uncanny, careless, and blatant. “Are y—”
<br><br>

“Shh. . .I sense a presence.” He searched around. “Do you hear it?”
<br><br>

He frowned, trying to hear what he sensed in their hideout. 
<br><br>

*Thump*
<br><br>

*Thump*
<br><br>

*CRACK*
<br><br>

Someone fell from the ceiling. They approached the person.
<br><br>

He smiled. “Who do we have here?”
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

“Getaway by umbrella, an unknown motive, and are well-known culprits,” said the Chief, walking in circles. "I must investigate the Underworld.”
<br><br>

He sips his drink. “Undyne, your daring caliber overwhelms me. . .I’ll come!”
<br><br>

“But you’ve become senile—”
<br><br>

He smacked her. “Don't insult y‘er old man. I’m as agile as ever. I will only capture the rascal.”
<br><br>

“Papyrus? He’s not a criminal.”
<br><br>

“He would be an asset, lassie.” —he tiled RASCAL on the Enchanted Scrabble— “The board says he went to see his brother.”
<br><br>

“I knew it! He was there.”
<br><br>

“Not to fear. He returned home. By capture, I meant convincing him.”
<br><br>

Undyne sighed because Gerson is difficult to disagree with. He often had reasonable points at doing what he thought was necessary.
<br><br>

She phoned the King to let him take charge of the office. He asked for a practical reason for her request, sweating at a loss for words, and stuttered. Gerson answered. “She earns a break for overworking, oldie mate.”
<br><br>

“. . .This is a rarity,” he said. “Since I have no major work to do,  I will accept to take over, but under a condition.”
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

——r played his dagger, bored. “You have no guilt. You’re a shame to my career.”
<br><br>

“Why do you wish to join us?” Frisk said. 
<br><br>

They didn't restrain the person as they assumed it as unneeded.
<br><br>

“I’ll avenge a person.”
<br><br>

Frisk studied him, elbowing him twice.
<br><br>

He leaned to the fellow criminal and shook, grinning. “Tsk, tsk, tsk. A liar’s pants are in fire. Your real goal is to destroy us.” He put his dagger at the faller's heart. “And, mostly—”
<br><br>

“I’m not lying!” 
<br><br>

“You are. Lies are written on your face. You have nobody to hate. We aren't fools. Wanna know why? Because we're the deceivers.” He puts the dagger on his head to symbolize foolery.
<br><br>

The faller was horrified and stayed quiet.
<br><br>

He prepares to stab him. “Goodbye.”
<br><br>

Frisk leaned on the wall, taken by surprise as the wall beside him exploded. “Watch out!”
<br><br>

The offender snickered and pushed him, rushing to the trajectory of smoke. 
<br><br>

——r threw the dagger but he dodged.
<br><br>

“It didn't hit!” He wore a weaponized jetpack then stood afloat out of the building. “You haven't seen the last of me!” He thrusted away. Boastful scumbags. 
<br><br>

The leader went and touched the wall. “Hm. We should relocate.”
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

Written reds: <br>
You are dishonest in my eyes, <br>
I believed you, and you betrayed me. <br>
The depraved is deprive of humanity, <br>
But I call my killing kindness, mercy. <br>
Try to flee away from remorse, <br>
For my next target will be you.
