<p class="blocktext"><b>??? Years Ago</b>
<br><br>
	
A meeting held in Asgore's Kingdom, having a private discussion with his friend, W.D. Gaster. Gaster recommended an idea to destroy the barrier, but it troubled him, for it may cause a perilous threat in the Underground.
<br><br>
	
Regardless, Gaster convinced him of trying his plan. It wasted time on settling, but he began deciding if he either chose the safety of monsters or his treacherous doable way of eliminating the barrier.
<br><br>
 
"Are you sure this method of yours will work?"
<br><br>
 
"Yes, I'm certain, Asgore."
<br><br>
 
"Then you may do it. But if it does deteriorate, the aftermath is dire."
<br><br>
 
“Without a problem. I have a solution for counteracting." He bowed and left.
<br><br>
 
"Ensure me this," said the King as he distanced. "You shall not use our kind for your proposition, Gaster." 
<br><br>
 
He paused, darting at the King. "I'll hold onto it."
<br><br>
 
Asgore came to his feet. "If you do abolish your plan, I can wait and execute the two humans."
<br><br>
 
Gaster scowled about him undervaluing his talent. 
<br><br>
 
<i>I allow you to challenge me. My people’s fate will be on you for a wager. The accusation is on me.</i> 
<br>

<i>Entry 23_4: Pity</i>
<br>
	
It took Asgore hours to authorize, for my endeavor to destroy the barrier is risky. Promises, he still falls for those conjectures, and because of his grudge against humans, this city is neglected. His habitual sacrifices are impressive, yet they can cause his downfall. He may have ridiculed me, but the belief of revenge is nonsensical for an honorable King.
<br><br>
 
Gaster ceased walking as he heard a crack. He set his shoe a step back, recognizing a hand necklace. He grabbed it and continued going on track. 
<br><br>
 
He disliked fallen commodities because it would mean the previous owner is lethargic and ignorant of his surroundings. But based on his experience as a scientist, unnatural outputs are worthwhile analyzing, for its mystery is far broader.

<b>Lab + PoV</b>
<br>
I woke up weak. My eye sockets were painful. I could sit, but not stand. My memory is vague, but I recalled a man who wore a brown lab coat, with a white turtleneck sweater and pants. He has these classy goggles, and his hands are holed. 
<br> <br>
 
"Don't move extensively. You’ll get yourself hurt." 
 <br> <br>
 
It's him. Did he put me in this cell? I planned to escape, but don't know how to in my state. I obeyed him as he came from behind.
 <br> <br>
 
"Don’t intend to do mischievous deeds. It’ll be a disgrace."
 <br> <br>
 
I looked at my black clothing. "I wasn't, but can I ask questions?”
 <br> <br>
 
He aimed a gun at my forehead. "You're fabricating. If you insist you're telling truth, then be it. Ask me specific queries. Make it concise, meddler."
 <br> <br>
 
"Who are you? What is this place?" 
 <br> <br>
 
"I'm Gaster, your creator. My laboratory.” 
 <br> <br>
 
If he's a brainiac, confusing him is tough. He may have put traps here. "How come I understand?"
 <br> <br>
 
"You can talk and interpret as I instructed you."
 <br> <br>
 
"When?"
 <br> <br>
 
“Hours ago.” He clicked the gun. “40 Celsius. For a skeleton, you have an abnormal heat."
 <br> <br>
 
"What happened?"
 <br> <br>
 
He became annoyed. “You've asked what’s integral for you, Sans. Give yourself a rest, and quit bothering me."
 <br> <br>
 
He's leaving.
<br> <br>
 
"Wait! At least tell me is Sans my name?"
 <br> <br>
 
"Yes it is," he said, putting the light off. "Sleep. Your awakening is of unpleasant timing."—he closed the door.
 <br> <br>
 
I turned my head to check this place. I exhaled, it's blank. 
 <br> <br>
 
I laid on the floor. Heh, he could have given me a mattress. My company is the idle light bulb. If I wasn't incapacitated, I could’ve on it. 
 <br> <br>

. . .I'm bone-tired. . guess I'll sleep. . after all. .

Gaster banged his hand on the desk. The experiment he created is the least he needs. Its existence is of sheer luck. He finger tapped.
 <br> <br>
 
"Your soul is weak but you persisted."
 <br> <br>
 
He is disappointed though he acted calm and reached the experiment. Ages he misused but acquired the worst feasible result. He grimaced. An aberration to deal with. 
 <br> <br>
 
"You're deemed ineffective for my mission, but you'll stay here for else, do you understand?"
 <br> <br>
 
The experiment didn't perceive him.
 <br> <br> 
 
"I have to teach you communication." 
 <br> 
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
 <br>	
Instructing the experiment is of remarkable clarity. 
 <br> <br>
 
<i>Entry 24_4: Faulty</i>
 <br>
	
A failed experiment of low hp learned faster than an average experiment. This type of experiment can have an unfavorable characteristic as they improve. I have to be cautious about him.
 <br> <br>
 
"What do you prefer to be known as, experiment?"
 <br> <br>
 
The experiment thought for a moment—
 <br> <br>
 
"Sans."
 <br> <br>
 
"What?"
 <br> <br>
 
"Can I be Sans?"
 <br> <br>
 
"I see. Your choice of name is quite rough, but sure, Sans it is."
 <br> <br>
 
He passed out, making Gaster take care of him. "A fever lasting for days."
 <br> <br>
 
He brought Sans into an isolated room, getting him nothing.
 <br> <br>
 
Although this happened earlier on the day when he came from Asgore's, it was Gaster having a senseless flashback.
 <br> <br>
 
In the current, he used his typewriter, documenting the events of the month. 
 <br> <br>
 
He released another experiment. A skeleton favorable than Sans. He trained it thoroughly as it progressed slower. In terms of vitality, he is greater. He labeled him Papyrus because his emotions are as fragile as paper. Broken into expressions.
 <br> <br>
 
Days had passed. Gaster didn't do a significant change in their manners. He figured Papyrus is polite and Sans, the adamant fool. Because of it, their personalities clash, but they do get along like brothers, to which this treacle repelled him.
 <br> <br>
 
Proper customs mattered in the Underground, but he himself is cruel to his experiments, torturing and manipulating them by his will. It served as punishment and examination of their endurance. 
 <br> <br>
 
He scoured new data from the two. He placed them in a separate room for his objective and put them in the container supplementing their body structure, specifically Sans. Calculating their performance from low to high and gathering the result.
 <br> <br>
 
"An ambiguous linkage," Gaster said, observing and taking note of information he'd reserved. "You won't be helpful, but the possibilities of the future are an obscure deceit.”
