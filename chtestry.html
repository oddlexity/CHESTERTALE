<p class="blocktext">"Long before war broke out in the Underground, there were humans and monsters, they lived happily in the towns of Winter'd Inn and in the previous capital. However, because humans are highly opinionated than monsters, it evoked a fallacious argument on the monsters' authority over humans in the Underground. One day, the disagreement worsened and turned into conflict, thus, inducing trifle but enormous destruction and fatalities. . . In the end, the humans were the victors. They formed a barrier that will lock the monsters forever, for fear they may take revenge. King Asgore, enraged by their barbarity, authorized his people to slay seven humans who dare enters, using its souls to break the barrier, and at last initiate their reprisal."
<br><br>
	
"Exceptional. The archaeologist wrote this in his prime?" Gaster asked the librarian.
<br><br>
	
"Yes, Sir Gaster. But may I ask why you constantly view the introduction?"
<br><br>
	
"Hm. He described it accurately. Not too short nor long in descriptive form. It's sufficient don't you think?"
<br><br>
	
"Yes...?" The librarian said, discontented his query is disregarded.
<br><br>
	
Gaster closed and grabbed the book. "I'll use it," he said, walking towards the door.
<br><br>
	
"Sir Gaster you need King Asgore's—"
<br><br>
	
"Permission. I don't need permission from a friend and besides, you're a mere librarian, so stay out of my field." 
<br><br>
	
He bewildered at Gaster's forthrightness.
<br><br>
	
Gaster opened the door. "You can report to the King if you want, but the answer would be the same, won't it?" He said, exiting the Librarby.
<br><br>
	
The librarian eased. I swear he can barge in and insult anyone! He should have assigned a courteous scientist.

He walked till he reached the Waterfall, and sat on a stone. Reading the book, nonchalant, but as the librarian said: he only viewed the beginning repeatedly, because his days are chiefly used in the lab, in favor of studying his experiments. It had pieces of history he knows, yet some he doesn't comprehend. He read chapters, giving meanings to the forgotten past, and discovering the origin of early experiments. After reading countless pages, Gaster saw instructions written in the language of the hands, Wingdings. Concluding Gerson needed help from a skeleton to write it, for they're the ones who use the symbols.
<br><br>
"Go to Winter'd Inn and there you may find a device, which can see the visions no normal monsters notice upon their eyes. Locate a sector buried by olden snows. Once you found it, the device awaits and it's yours to take and own."
<br><br>
Gaster closed the book. He was tired, staying indifferent. The task would be done on a different day as he had work to do in the Lab. Though instead of walking, he teleported to a room where the subject is held in a compartment. Gaster created this experiment of his several years ago for monster research, but had hardships in fulfilling it. He'll release it to test its stability and statistics a second time, for a week to get the possibility of making a stronger form of living weapon.
